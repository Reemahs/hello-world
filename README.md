# hello-world
Getting upto speed with the hub!

I'm Shameer. Right now I am plaing around with Github. I'm studying Control Systems engineer with a deep interest in software development, big data, machine learning and distributed systems. 

I'm going to be posting some of my projects here in the short future so stay tuned :)
